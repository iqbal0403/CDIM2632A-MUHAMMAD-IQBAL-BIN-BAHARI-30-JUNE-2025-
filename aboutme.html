      <p>My name is Muhammad Iqbal bin Bahari, and I am 21 years old. I come from a loving and supportive family of six, and I am the third of four siblings. Growing up in such a dynamic household has taught me the value of cooperation, patience, and mutual respect—qualities that I continue to carry with me in both academic and personal settings.

      I would describe myself as someone who enjoys challenges and is always ready to push boundaries. I believe that stepping out of comfort zone is one of the best ways to grow and improve as a person. Whether it’s learning something new, solving a difficult problem, or adapting to change, I see challenges as opportunities to become better and stronger.

      In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and football. These hobbies not only provide me with a way to unwind after a busy day but also sharpen my strategic thinking and build my sense of discipline and teamwork. Football especially has taught me how to collaborate, trust others, and stay committed to a common goal. Meanwhile, video games often challenge my creativity, reflexes, and decision-making under pressure.

      Altogether, my background and interests have shaped me into a curious, driven, and open-minded individual—always ready to learn and contribute meaningfully in any environment I’m placed in.</p>

  <div class="text-content">
      <p>My educational journey has been a meaningful path of growth, curiosity, and discovery. I began my early education at Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Lintang, where I built the foundation of my academic skills and first developed a passion for learning. I then continued to Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Air Molek, where I was actively involved in both academic and extracurricular activities. It was during these secondary years that I began to shape my interests and realize the importance of setting long-term goals.

      After completing SPM, I pursued my pre-university studies at Kolej Tingkatan Enam Tun Fatimah. Form Six was both a challenging and rewarding phase in my life. It taught me how to manage time wisely, study independently, and develop deeper thinking skills.

      Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Information Content Management (CDIM263) at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Puncak Perdana Campus. This program focuses on how information is created, organized, managed, and disseminated in both digital and non-digital formats. I have gained knowledge in metadata, digital preservation, HTML/CSS, UX, and knowledge management.

      What I enjoy most about my field of study is how relevant and dynamic it is. In an age where content is constantly created and consumed, learning how to manage information ethically, efficiently, and creatively is both a skill and a responsibility.</p>

  <div class="text-content">
      <p>As a student of Information Content Management, I am particularly interested in careers that focus on organizing, curating, and delivering meaningful content through digital platforms. I am drawn to roles such as Content Strategist, Digital Curator, Information Architect, or UX Content Designer.

      I believe that clear, well-managed information plays a key role in user experience, brand communication, and digital success. I enjoy working with both structure and creativity—combining technical skills like metadata, taxonomy, and web content design with storytelling, branding, and user-centric thinking.

      In the future, I aim to become a professional who can lead digital content teams, develop user-friendly platforms, and contribute to building inclusive and informative digital ecosystems. I want to be part of a company that values both innovation and integrity in how content is delivered—through websites, apps, or emerging technologies.</p>
